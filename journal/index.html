			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    	<br><p>- Created plan for conducting research
			    		<br>- Looked for relevant literature
			    		<br>- Created template for fake computer science course page
			    		<br>- Attended HCI lab meetings
			    	</p>

			  <tr>
			    <br><h1>Week 2</h1>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    	<br><p>- Worked on and submitted IRB proposal
				  <br>- Created study interfaces, one stereotypical and one non-stereotypical
				  <br>- Started looking into recruiting participants
				  <br>- Booked an experiment space
				  <br>- Analyzed data for a separate, related project on motherhood bias
				  
					</p>

			    <br><h1>Week 3</h1>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    	<br><p>- Lots of new interns starting this week
				  <br>- Started working on Qualtrics survey
				  <br>- Created recruitment materials (posters)
				  
					</p>
			  </tr>
			<tr>
			    <br><h1>Week 4</h1>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    	<br><p>- Contacted participant populations (looking at Stanford summer programs for highschoolers)
				  <br>- Danaë did a power analysis to figure out how many participants we need
				  <br>- Still waiting on IRB
				  <br>- Contacted Sapna Cheryan for original study materials on ambient belonging
				  <br>- Piloted Qualtrics survey around the lab
				  
					</p>
			  </tr>
				<tr>
			    <br><h1>Week 5</h1>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    	<br><p>- Pre-tested our websites on Amazon Mechanical Turk to ensure that interfaces are indeed stereotypical and non-stereotypical
				  <br>- Got original study materials from Sapna, incorporating them into our survey
				  <br>- Wrote pre-registration for Open Science Framework
				  <br>- Received IRB feedback to update our IRB proposal
				  
					</p>
			  </tr>
				<tr>
			    <br><h1>Week 6</h1>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    	<br><p>- IRB proposal finally approved! We can start sending out recruitment materials and running the study
				  <br>- Piloted the survey on MTurk
				  <br>- Piloted the full in-person procedure
				  <br>- Figured out method of compensation for participants
				  <br>- Wrote analysis scripts in python
				  <br>- Booked rooms for running the study
				  
					</p>
			  </tr>
				<tr>
			    <br><h1>Week 7</h1>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    	<br><p>- Began running participants in lab
				  <br>- Because we aren't sure we'll receive enough participants, we decided to also run the study online
				  <br>- Launched Facebook ad to recruit 16-20 year olds to participate in the study, currenting analyzing this data
				  
					</p>
			  </tr>
				<tr>
			    <br><h1>Week 8</h1>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    	<br><p>- Data from Facebook participants turned out to be low-quality; we got a lot of respondents but there were a lot of people trying to cheat and take it multiple times
				  <br>- Facebook participants were 70% female, male populations did not randomize well
				  <br>- Facebook data shows significant differences in DV's by gender but not condition, but this data isn't really valid anyway
				  <br>- Figuring out next steps for getting better data, will probably run on MTurk on 18-25 year olds
				  <br>- Still running in-person participants
				  <br>- Started writing a CHI paper draft
				  
					</p>
			  </tr>
				<tr>
			    <br><h1>Week 9</h1>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    	<br><p>- MTurk data yielded positive results that supported our hypothesis!
				  <br>- Saw differences by gender for most DV's and also by condition
				  <br>- Thinking about how to extend this work and looking at the big picture
				  <br>- Planning on building a quantitative model for inclusive design to validate on real life interfaces
				  <br>- Working on CHI short paper
				  
					</p>
			  </tr>
				<tr>
			    <br><h1>Week 10</h1>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    	<br><p>- Finished up first draft of CHI paper
				  <br>- This was my last week, and I'm glad to say I had a really great time this summer at Stanford. Thank you Danaë, James Landay, and CRA-W for providing me with this opportunity!
