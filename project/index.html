			<p>My project is on ambient belonging in online interfaces. Ambient belonging is defined as the perceived fit with an environment and the community that inhabits that environment. Building upon prior research on ambient belonging in physical spaces, our project focuses on digital spaces and examines if interfaces can serve as environments that influence a user's sense of belonging and comfort.</p>
			<p> By looking at the effects of stereotypical cues in an online setting, we hope to replicate the same effect as in a physical space, which has implications for bigger issues such as the underrepresentation of women and minorities in STEM. </p>
